# Image Dataset Labeling App

![App Preview](./preview.jpeg)

## Overview
This app is designed for creating and viewing labeled image datasets, specifically with bounding boxes. It is tailored for iPads and offers full support for Apple Pencil, ensuring precise and intuitive labeling. It can also be used on iPhones with touch input, providing versatility for users on the go. Currently, the Mac version offers limited functionality, only allowing dataset viewing, though this feature is still in development.

## Key Features
- **Intuitive Labeling Tools**: Create bounding boxes with ease using the Apple Pencil or touch gestures.
- **Cross-Device Support**: Optimized for iPad, functional on iPhone, and limited viewing capabilities on Mac.
- **Dataset Management**: Organize labeled data efficiently with clear visual and textual indicators of classes and labels.

## Current Limitations
- Mac functionality is restricted to viewing datasets, and even this is not fully polished.

## Getting Started
### Installation
